# PulseCheck

PulseCheck is a lightweight WordPress plugin that provides high-signal diagnostic
checks for developers and agencies maintaining WordPress sites.

## Philosophy

PulseCheck is intentionally conservative.

It focuses on a small number of well-understood system conditions that reliably
correlate with real-world maintenance, stability, and security risks.

This plugin prioritizes:
- Signal over coverage
- Diagnostics over remediation
- Explanation over enforcement

## What PulseCheck Does

- Adds custom checks to the WordPress Site Health screen
- Evaluates environment and configuration risks
- Provides clear, developer-readable explanations
- Makes no changes to the site

## What PulseCheck Does Not Do

- Automatically fix issues
- Scan for vulnerabilities or CVEs
- Replace security or performance plugins
- Provide guarantees about exploitability

## Target Audience

PulseCheck is designed for:
- WordPress developers
- Agencies
- Technical site maintainers

It is not intended for non-technical site owners.

## Current Checks (v0.1)

- PHP version compatibility and risk assessment

## License
